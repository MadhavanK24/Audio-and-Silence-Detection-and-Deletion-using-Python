# Audio-and-Silence-Detection-and-Deletion-using-Python
This Python project detects and removes silence from audio files using libraries like Pydub, Librosa, and NumPy. It identifies silent segments based on amplitude thresholds and deletes them to streamline audio processing. Ideal for podcast editing, speech recognition, and music processing, it enhances user experience and reduces file size.
